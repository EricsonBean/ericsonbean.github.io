         <h3> Stayed at Teanaway campground (no fee, no reservations). Would expect there to be almsot always room.
           First day, did a climb to the top of Main ridge and loped back down to the campsite on some beautiful single track.
           The gravel roads can be a bit loose making the climbs difficult. Most of the trails are exposed to the sun and can
           be quite hot in the summer, making the climbs gruleing. Reccommend sticking to the gravel for climbing vice single track.
           Incredible views of the Enchanmtents to the north once at the top of the ridge.

       <h3> Stayed at Little Naches Campground. Plenty of cmapsites and disperesed campging in the area,
        would expect there to be almsot always room. Rode up a very well kept forest road to the top of  West Quartz. 
        Singletrack downhill was flowy fun in sections, mostly rideable with a couple narrow,
        loose sections along the hill side which are best walked. Great views on the single track down.

         <h3>Rode up forest road 5620, a bumpier gravel climb with some great views near the top. 
          Should have still be quite fresh for the Single track down. The single track was overgrown and had lots of fallen logs.
          The single track is slow moving and a full body workout with the hike and back.
          Luckily there is the river to replenish your camelbackWas stil able to ride most of it but was slow moving. 
          I bail out of the lower singletrack seciotn andd return on the gravel for I was running out of daylight.
          This ride will most likely be a slogfest every summer and should plan for a long day with some hike and bike.

           <h3>Climbed up FS 26, a mostly paved road with very little traffic. 
           Turned left onto Boundary trail for a climb with loose dirt followed by some hike and bike made up for
           with great views of Mt St Helens. Lots of fallen trees throughout the singletrack, mostly on boundary trail.
           Strawberry ridge starts with A steep but doable climb only if you have a whole lot of gas left.
           Turns into a more lower gradient climb with views once you near Strawberry ridge.
           Massive uniterrupted steep, somewhat flowy downhill back to FS 26.
