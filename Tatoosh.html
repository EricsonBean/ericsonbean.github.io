    <h2>Zipper Couloir, March 2023</h2>

          <p1>Two friends and I started at the Narada Falls Trailhead at around 10 am. It's a short climb
            to the Steven Canyon Road which will be closed for the winter. After 10 minutes you reach a bend in the road
            where you make your first transition and have a short run to the south towards Tatoosh Creek. Once 
            past the creek,the most difficult part of the tour is finding the best route to reach the saddle east of Lane's Peak.
            We had to boot a steep 200 ft section on our way to the basin east of Lane's peak. The basin is easy touring
            and will tempt you for a quick lap to get some turns. From here there are many areas to explore. For Zipper
            and Fly Couloirs, we headed to the looker's right towards Lane's peak. Zipper couloir is reached by heading
            to the looker's right of the summit to find the entrance. The couloir opens up into an apron. Once in the apron,
            we decided to boot up to the looker's right of Fly Couloir for anotehr short lap. To head back, follow the apron
            down to the skier's right to transition and climb back out towards Steven Canyon Road.
