          <p1>A friend and I met up to try and conquer Slot Couloir. We hit the trail around nine starting
            from the second Alpental Lot. We skinned on snow lake trail until we saw some previous skin tracks
            head up through the trees towards Snoqualmie Mountain. The skining up through the trees was difficult 
            and required booting at times. Skinning was easier above the tree line until higher towards the summit where
            the snow got icier which required some mroe booting. We reached the top of the couloir around 2pm. The couloir
            looked menacing from above but was not extremely difficult to ski. The snow eventaully turned to some dry powder
            as the couloir began to open up. We exited the couloir to the skiers left to head towards the exit couloir to head back
            for it was getting late. Both of our skins began to fail so we had a tough hike to the top of the exit couloir. 
            We followed previous track to make it through Phantom Glades to get back to Alpental, making sure to avoid skiing off a cliff
            as we got further down the mountain. We got back to our car just as it started getting dark around 430pm.
