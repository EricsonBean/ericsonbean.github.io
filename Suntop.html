          <h3>August 2022</h3>
          <p1>I started from my camping spot on Forest Rd 73. There is a lot of dispersed camping here but does receive 
            some noisy traffic in the summer. Its a long gravel climb with an extra 700 ft once you get on single track.
             The ridge is mostly covered but some views of Ranier to the South if you hike up a bit to the side. The downhill
              is flowy and fast. The dirt was little loose in the summer and I slid out on the trail at one point but thankfully 
              did not get too scraped up. The end of the  downhil gets a bit more technical and ends at the old airport which has a ton of camping. I would reccommend camping
               and starting from here. It is a more central place for other trails and is quieter; this is where I cmaped the next day.
                I was running out of daylight so I rode back on 410 but there is the option for single track on Skookum Flats trail.
