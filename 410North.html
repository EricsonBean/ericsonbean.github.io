          <p1>I did this ride on a hot day after riding Suntop two days prior so the 3000 ft gravel climb over 6 miles up
            Corral Pass Road was tough. However, the climb was straight forward and opened up to great views at the end. The 
            Noble Knob Trail had great views to the south of ranier. take a left onto Dalles Rdige Trail to start the long 
            descent down. At the right time of the year, the wildflowers will be as high as your shoulders. This is a popular 
            hiking trails so expect some traffic. I kept right to take the Palisades Trail down, passing cliffs overlooking 
            the valley below. The trail ends with carrying down your bike down some steep switchbacks and janky staircases. 
            I got back on White River Trail to return to my campsite at Ranger Creek airstrip.
