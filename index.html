    <h2>Biking</h2>
      <p1>Trips to all the best biking destinations in Washington. Single track and soley gravel ride options. 
          Most gravel rides remain untested by myself. Strava and RideWithGps heat maps were used to try and create
          Forest Road loops. Road conditions for a gravel bike will vary, some may best be ridden with suspension before
          given the all clear. A lot of rides will start from the closest campsite. This ensures you will have a camp spot
          should your ride run late. Washington has a ton of downhill focused bike parks as well as hiking trail stlyle rides
          with a lot of elevation and possibly some hike and bike. The ladder is the ride i normally go for, and usually
          acheived through a long gravel climb followed by a rugged downhill back to the van.</h3></div>

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p1>Trips to some of the best hikes in Washington. While there are an endless amount of hikes, I tired to narrow it
          down to longer loops that will have you out in the wilderness the whole day. And then some hikes where the out 
          and back is unavoidable to reach the rewarding view. Some smaller hikes are included for an easier,
          rest or recovery day.

    <h2>Skiing</h2>
      <p1>Planning a  backcountry tour can be extrememly difficult and is heavily dependent on snow conditions.
          A major limiting factor depends on accessibility, this is why a lot of touring is done from ski resorts
          that are at the foor of high, aloine areas ideal for skiing. Washington ski resorts do allow van camping
          which is also ideal for an early start to a day of touring.
