          <p1>I responded to a Facebook goup post and got plans to do this tour with two strangers. It was my first time doing a meetup like this and it absolutely
             worked out, except for the fact that I could barely keep up die to one of them beimh in the special forces and the other one an ultra runner. Unfortunately, 
            the weather was not great and we had zero views the entire time. this tome of the year, we hiked about a mule on the summer trail
            until we could start skinning. Its a straight climb up, needing only to find a way with sufficient snow cover. The snow this time of the year was mushy and malee for 
            toth skinning as we kept slipping. At the top, it was complete whiteout and we wuickly transistioned and headed down. The summit was icy for boarding but conditions 
            as we descended. It was a unique experience skiing through the black, volcanic rock. This is a tough climb but I more rewarding on a clearer day.
