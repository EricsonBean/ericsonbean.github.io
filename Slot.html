          <p1>A friend and I met up to try and conquer Slot Couloir. We hit the trail around nine starting
            from the second Alpental Lot. We skinned on Snow Lake Trail until we saw some previous skin tracks
            head up through the trees towards Snoqualmie Mountain. The skining up through the trees was difficult 
            and required booting at times to get past some icy sections. Skinning was easier above the tree line until higher towards the summit where
            the snow got icier, requiring more booting. We reached the top of the couloir around 2pm. The couloir
            looked menacing from above but was not extremely difficult to ski. The entrance was slick ice witha thin cover
            but it turned to dry powder around the first bend. We exited the couloir down the apron to the skiers left to head towards the exit couloir
            for it was getting late. Both of our skins began to fail so we had a tough hike to the top of the exit couloir. 
            We followed previous tracks to make it through Phantom Glades back to Alpental. There is the chance here to cliff out so be careful.
            We got back to our car just as it was starting to get dark around 430pm.
