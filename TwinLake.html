    <h2>Twin Lakes Couloir, March 2023</h2>
       <div class="row">
         <div class="column2">
          <p1>We approached Twin lake via the Snoqualmie nordic trail that takes you along Cold Creek. From the Nordic Trails
            it's a short, flat skin to Twin Lakes. You can save time on the nordic trails by removing your skins for more glide.
            Once on the eastern lake, head south to start skinning up to the apron of the couloir. Head to the looker's left of
            the cliffs visible from the lake. Once at the couloir, we made the decision early to start booting. It was a warm day
            which caused more ice chunks to fall from the surrounding cliffs. THe booting was exhausting but the views of Ranier
            to the south were worth. Once at the ridge, you could choose to ski the south side for a lap if conditions allow.
            The couloir is narrow, yet not too steep with plenty of room to turn. This is a very beginner friendly couloir if
            willing to boot if conditions don't allow skinning. I would like to find a way to approach the couloir from the south
            to avoid having to boot up it.
