          <p1>Two friends and I statred at the Narada Falls Trailhead at around 10 am. Its a short climb
            to the closed for winter Steven Canyons road. After 10 minutes you reach a bend in the road where you
            make your first transition and have a short run to the south towards Tatoosh Creek. Once pass the creek,
            the most difficult part of the tour is finding the best route to reach the saddle east of Lane's Peak.
            We had to boot a steep 200 ft section on our way to the basin east of Lane's peak. The basin is easy touring
            and will get you excited for some turns. This is some simpler terrain
