          <p1>We started our commonwelath approach to Kendall Adventure Zone at 730am. It took us 3 hrs
            to reach the entrance of the Twins Couloirs. There were a few peopel reaching KAZ the time we were but there
            were few tracks into the bowl. Jake took the skier's right couloir while
            I took the left. Conditions were incredible as we met up at th bottom of the Sisters to rip down the apron
            togehter. We skied to the skiers right to head towards the base of the most
            Eastern couloirs, Icy Gash and Silver Lining. We  transitioned and skinned 2 hours to the top of Silver
            Lining. My friend skied Gash while I went back down Silver Lining. Once at the botttom, we headed back
            West to skin out of the "Not So Super Steep" Couloir. At this point we were both losing steam for our thrid
            climb but we had plnety of daylight left and perservered. We then has one last run through the popular Kendall
            Trees to get back to the car.
