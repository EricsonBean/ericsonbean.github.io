          <h3>September 2022</h3>
          <p1>This is one of my favorite rides in Washington. I started from my disperesed campsite along the lake. There was 
            the option to camp on the shore of the lake but opted not for this without 4WD. The ride starts with a beautiful 
            stretch along the lake until the switch backs start up the ridge. Its a classic 3000 ft gravel climb to the top. 
            Once on hte single track, there is a tad of hike and bike before you start the descent. There are some beautiful 
            views of Mount Stuart at the top. The downhill is throuhg what seems to be an enchanted forrest. The flora on this 
            trail really stuck out to me as nothing I had seen before. There was some hiking activity coming up the trail. The 
            downhill was fast and rooty with some drops. I highly recommend this ride and area for camping.
