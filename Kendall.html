    <h2>The Twins and The Silver Lining Couloirs, March 2023</h2>
       <div class="row">
         <div class="column2">
          <p1>We started our commonwelath approach to Kendall Adventure Zone at 730am. It took us 3 hrs
            to reach the entrance of the Twins Couloirs. My friend took the skier's right couloir while
            I took the left. Conditions were incredible. We skied to the skiers right to head towards the most
            eastern couloirs, Icy Gash and Silver Lining. It took us about 2 hours to skin to the top of Silver
            Lining. My friend skied Gash while I went back down Silver Lining. Once at the botttom, we headed back
            west to skin out of the "Not So Super Steep" Couloir. Then one last run of the popular Kendall Trees to get
            back to the car.
