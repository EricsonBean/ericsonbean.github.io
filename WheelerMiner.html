          <p1>Hill and  I started from the base of the Gondola
            and made our way to Breck's Peak 7 Base to start the gravel
            climb up the ski resort. More mileage can be added by taling Burro Trail to the start of the Wheeler 
            Trail for more single track climbing. Taking the gravel route will get you within a mile of the ridge where 
            you drop off the backside towards Copper. The first descent is steep, fast and loose. The trail can be overgrown here as well.
             We passed a handful of hikers on this side of the ridge. The simgle track climb back out is steep and we found ourselves
             mostly hiking. Once back on the ridge, it seems lioe
            all of Frisco County is in sight. It can be quite windy. The descent down Miners Creek into Breck is rocky and relentless. 
            Once you descend into the forest, the trail gets very rocky and slow. at the end if Miners Creek, you can decide whether to take singletrack
             back to Breck or pop down on the paved recreation trail.
