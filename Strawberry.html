          <h3>August 2022</h3>
          <p1>I parked on the side of FS 26 as close to the donwhill trail exit. The 13 mile gravel climb up FS26 is smooth, scenic
            and had very little car traffic. I linked up with a gravel biker and tried to keep up with him for the last part of the climb 
            even though this was his third or fourth big climb of his day. Thankfully, he told me about a potable water faucet at the 
            Goat Mountain Trailhead. I would have been in bad shape had I not stopped to refill my camelbak. From here, you start the singletrack 
            climb up towards Strawberry Ridge. The climbing was loose and steep for my endurance level at the time and I was forced to hike large
             portions of the uphill. There was a handful of fallen tress across the trail. Depsite all the hiking, the views were worth it for you
              eventually got sight of Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Hood and Mount Ranier. The climbing got easier once on top of the Ridge. 
              After traversing the ridge for a few miles, the 3600 ft descent begins.
