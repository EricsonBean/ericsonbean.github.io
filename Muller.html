          <h3>September 2022</h3>
          <p1>I camped for the weekend at Klahoya Campground. The first day was rainy and overcast so opted for a gravel climb up
            East Twin River Road to Kloshe Nanitch. The singletrack down wasn't the most rewarding due to
            being overgrown and not too flowy with a lot of tight switchbacks. The next day I rode the Mount
            Muller loop clockwise. The climb is mostly all rideable but steep and unrelenting. There are some great
            views once on top of the ridge of Olympic Nat'l Park and Lake Crescent. The downhill was certainly rewarding, 
            smooth and flowy with rideable switchbacks. The bottom of the loop was an easy flat return to my campsite.
