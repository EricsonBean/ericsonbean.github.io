         <p1> Stayed at Teanaway campground (no fee, no reservations). Would expect there to be almsot always room.
           First day, did a climb to the top of Main ridge and loped back down to the campsite on some beautiful single track.
           The gravel roads can be a bit loose making the climbs difficult. Most of the trails are exposed to the sun and can
           be quite hot in the summer, making the climbs gruleing. Reccommend sticking to the gravel for climbing vice single track.
           Incredible views of the Enchanmtents to the north once at the top of the ridge.

       <p1> Stayed at Little Naches Campground. Plenty of campsites and dispersed camping in the area,
        would expect there to be almost always room. Rode up a very well kept forest road to the top of West Quartz. 
        Singletrack downhill was flowy fun in sections, mostly rideable with a couple narrow,
        loose sections along the hill side which are best walked. Great views on the single track down.

         <p1>Rode up forest road 5620, a bumpier gravel climb with some great views near the top. 
          Should have still be quite fresh for the Single track down. The single track was overgrown and had lots of fallen logs.
          The single track is slow moving and a full body workout with the hike and back.
          Luckily there is the river to replenish your camelbackWas stil able to ride most of it but was slow moving. 
          I bail out of the lower singletrack section and return on the gravel for I was running out of daylight.
          This ride will most likely be a slogfest every summer and should plan for a long day with some hike and bike.

           <p1>Climbed up FS 26, a mostly paved road with very little traffic. 
           Turned left onto Boundary trail for a climb with loose dirt followed by some hike and bike made up for
           with great views of Mt St Helens. Lots of fallen trees throughout the singletrack, mostly on boundary trail.
           Strawberry ridge starts with A steep but doable climb only if you have a whole lot of gas left.
           Turns into a more lower gradient climb with views once you near Strawberry ridge.
           Massive uninterrupted steep, somewhat flowy downhill back to FS 26.

           <p1>Camped on Forest Road 73 for the two night, lots of boondocking spots. Got busier towards the weekend.
               Switched to Buck Creek campground the last night, it is free with a NW Discovery pass and much quieter. 
               First ride was a gravel climb to the Suntop downhill. The beginning of singletrack is mostly climbing, 
               will need some reserve. After the first mile it lets up in to some great flowy downhill. The downhill gets technical and rocky
               near the end with some tight switchbacks. I rode 410 to get back to my boondock at FS 73 due to running
               out of daylight. Take sookums  flat for more singletrack if you have the time.<br>
               Second ride was climbing Corral Pass road, taking Noble Knob trail to get to Palisades downhill.
               I found this gravel climb to be tougher but more scenic. The singletrack has great views of Ranier
               most of the time and beaitful. tall wildflowers. I enjoyed this ride much more than the more popluar Suntop. 
               There is however a good bit of hike and bike at the end of the Palisades downhill.
               I finished the ride with White River trail to get back to campsite.

            <p1>Camped at Klahoya Campground. The first day was rainy overcast so opted for a gravel climb up
                East Twin River Road to Kloshe Nanitch. The singletrack down wasn't the most rewarding due to
                being overgrown and not too flowy with a lot of tight switchbacks. The next day I rode Mount
                Muller loop CW. The climb is not technical, all rideable, just steep and unrelenting. Great
                views all along the ridge to Mount Muller View were worth the stop and go climbing. The downhill
                was certainly rewarding, smooth and flowy with rideable switchbacks. The bottom of the loop was
                an easy flat return to the van.

            <p1>I camped along Kachess Lake, plenty of disperesed camping on Forest Road 4818. From there,
                I rode the Kachess Ridge the first day. A tough gravel climb with great views of the lake.
                There is some steep hike and bike once you get to the singletrack. The singlestrack descent
                is not too stepp, allows you to really enoy the beautiful meadows and forest yu ride through.
                Some technical sections best walked, but mostly rideable. No fallen trees or overgrown sections.
                Several creek crossings, most are rideable, all are crossable while remaining dry. On the second day,
                gravel climbed to the top of Cle Elum Ridge to take in the views and then took Rat Pac down. Parts 
                of Rat Pac were heavily affected by logging but still a riot with plenty of optional jumps and features.

            <p1>I camped two nights on Canyon Creek Rd, a few miles past the town Glacier towards the ski resort. 
                I toured two days as part of AAIRE I. The first day we did a shorter tour to ski 10 minute trees into Bagley Basin.
                The next day we toured to do a tree run down towards Swift Creek.

            <p1>A friend and I met up to try and conquer Slot Couloir. We hit the trail around nine starting
              from the second Alpental Lot. We skinned on snow lake trail until we saw some previous skin tracks
              head up through the trees towards Snoqualmie Mountain. The skining up through the trees was difficult 
              and required booting at times. Skinning was easier above the tree line until higher towards the summit where
              the snow got icier which required some mroe booting. We reached the top of the couloir around 2pm. The couloir
              looked menacing from above but was not extremely difficult to ski. The snow eventaully turned to some dry powder
              as the couloir began to open up. We exited the couloir to the skiers left to head towards the exit couloir to head back
              for it was getting late. Both of our skins began to fail so we had a tough hike to the top of the exit couloir. 
              We followed previous track to make it through Phantom Glades to get back to Alpental, making sure to avoid skiing off a cliff
              as we got further down the mountain. We got back to our car just as it started getting dark around 430pm.
