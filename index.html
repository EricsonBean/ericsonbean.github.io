    <h2>Biking</h2>
      <p1>Trips to all the best biking destinations in Washington, single track and gravel ride options. 
          Most gravel rides remain untested by myself. I've been getting to most of the best singletrack in each area.
          Strava and RideWithGps heat maps were used to try and create Forest Road loops for gravel rides. Road conditions
          for a gravel bike will vary, some may best be ridden with suspension before getting reliable beta. A lot of rides
          will start from the closest campsite. This ensures you will have a camp spot should your ride run late. Washington
          has a ton of downhill focused bike parks as well as hiking trail stlyle rides with a lot of elevation and some hike and bike.
          The ladder is the ride I normally go for, and usually involves a long gravel climb followed by a rugged downhill back to the van.</h3></div>

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p1>Trips to some of the best hikes in Washington. While there are an endless amount of hikes, I tried to narrow it
          down to longer loops that will have you out in the wilderness the whole day. And then some hikes where the out 
          and back is unavoidable to reach the rewarding view. Some smaller hikes are included for an easier,
          rest or recovery day.

    <h2>Skiing</h2>
      <p1>Planning a backcountry tour can be extrememly difficult and is heavily dependent on snow conditions.
          A major limiting factor for a tour depends on accessibility. That is why a lot of touring is done
          from ski resorts that are at the foot of high, alpine areas above the treeline ideal for skiing. Washington
          ski resorts do allow van camping and have electrical hook-ups which is ideal for an early start to a long day
          backcountry. They require reservations and are booked as soon as they are released.
